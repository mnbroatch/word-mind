Betting Skill / Equipment
  - you wager on whether your next guess is correct

====================

Support levels with multiple games
  - a "level that is only a usual game" is a sequence of 1 games
  - a level where the first game is min word length and the last game is max word length

===============

Iron Drop
  - If a letter's been marked present but ruled out of 3 locations, reveal its location

===============

Amulet of Using The Scrabble Dictionary

===============

Amulet of uniqueness
- Stores every starting word you've ever used and doesn't let you use the same one twice
- just kinda useless for 1 and 2 length words? That's probably ok

===============

Current money becomes XP / levels
- 1 skill point per level

Skills cost skill points
  - Each has 5 options
    - maybe different skills have different # of options
  - Can be upgraded by earning mastery
  - Each option stops giving mastery after a certain point
  - Maxing all options rewards the "use a random option" option that gives a lot of xp


Separate money buys consumables
  - backward tonic, for one
  - all mastery gained is money, vice versa ?
    - might be too hard


================





refactor: 

- scss mixin for shadow color

================

UX:

Use item names, hover for description
Separate screen to upgrade items
invalid guess wiggle / other feedback

disable impossible option combinations
click letter you want to edit
flag letters as unusable
  - toggle in cordner? 
  - right click / long press ?

---------------


modifiers:

cpu makes a free guess for you

bomb that takes out unused letters
  - eliminate X random unused letters


- free one-letter guess

- off-by-one tolerance

- vowel swap
  - no vowel hits ? fill in all vowels

- spear pillar randomly turn everything upside down / sidewars / invisible
  - disable orange / green / both

- antiwordle
  - have to guess words that fit the clues
  - difference is that you want to guess more obscure things, etc

- ghost mode
  - 

all of my best ideas are ruined by the fact that the list of candidate words is so low after a few guesses






================

bugs:

clear all should do the same as clear all + refresh()
close button is being hit on last word submit
can use keyboard to enter guess even on game end options menu
tab can zoom around inactive modal buttons


================

higher-level:

story:
  - guy chokes on scrabble letter
  - wakes up and discovers he can accomplish anything if he wordles hard enough
    - blacks out, wordles, wakes up to completed task


hidden secrets
  - maybe there's room in the modal background to flash a secret word between modals
    - Can definitely construct a custom transition that allows it
  - dark mode
    - some hints can only be seen light, some dark
      - how to pull this off without making hints too obvious in light mode
        - maybe in dark mode, an obvious hint appears that leads to a similar but less conspicuous hint in light mode
      - hints to what? maybe a cheat code, or an answer to be inputted behind the options screen




attach rpg items to modifiers?
  - changing the numeric option is like "upgrading the item"

inventory
  - potions change rules for a number of games
    - adds status effect which can be added other ways too, good or bad
  - idols open up options
  - currency



ending
limited lives mode
anagrams bonus round
change rules in the middle of a game?



=================

"cooking" mechanic where certain combinations of options give bonus?
  - strict mode + timers
  - boards count vs letter count

===============

bug - unlocking and immediately setting word length 6 doesn't update board size

================

mini-mode:
  - Start with 2 guesses
  - Any newly-present letter grants a bones guess

==================

Balance (?)
  - If you spend them immediately, you will gain a skill every 10 games.
  - if you don't, you'll gain a skill level less. let the math decide how much.
  - each mastery level n gives you xp(n+1) per game
  - gotta work out the math for the xp-per-game curve

===============

HIDDEN:
playing with no modifiers should be a separate "skill" track. what's the reward?
