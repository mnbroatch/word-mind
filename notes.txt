Current money becomes XP / levels
Separate money 


================





refactor: 

- scss mixin for shadow color

================

UX:

Use item names, hover for description
Separate screen to upgrade items
invalid guess wiggle / other feedback

disable impossible option combinations
click letter you want to edit
flag letters as unusable
  - toggle in cordner? 
  - right click / long press ?

---------------


modifiers:

cpu makes a free guess for you

bomb that takes out unused letters
  - eliminate X random unused letters


- free one-letter guess

- off-by-one tolerance

- vowel swap
  - no vowel hits ? fill in all vowels

- spear pillar randomly turn everything upside down / sidewars / invisible
  - disable orange / green / both

- antiwordle
  - have to guess words that fit the clues
  - difference is that you want to guess more obscure things, etc

- ghost mode
  - 

all of my best ideas are ruined by the fact that the list of candidate words is so low after a few guesses






================

bugs:

clear all should do the same as clear all + refresh()
close button is being hit on last word submit
can use keyboard to enter guess even on game end options menu
tab can zoom around inactive modal buttons


================

higher-level:

story:
  - guy chokes on scrabble letter
  - wakes up and discovers he can accomplish anything if he wordles hard enough
    - blacks out, wordles, wakes up to completed task


hidden secrets
  - maybe there's room in the modal background to flash a secret word between modals
    - Can definitely construct a custom transition that allows it
  - dark mode
    - some hints can only be seen light, some dark
      - how to pull this off without making hints too obvious in light mode
        - maybe in dark mode, an obvious hint appears that leads to a similar but less conspicuous hint in light mode
      - hints to what? maybe a cheat code, or an answer to be inputted behind the options screen




attach rpg items to modifiers?
  - changing the numeric option is like "upgrading the item"

inventory
  - potions change rules for a number of games
    - adds status effect which can be added other ways too, good or bad
  - idols open up options
  - currency



ending
limited lives mode
anagrams bonus round
change rules in the middle of a game?
