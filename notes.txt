ux:

disable impossible option combinations
click letter you want to edit
flag letters as unusable
  - toggle in cordner? 
  - right click / long press ?

---------------


modifiers:

disable orange / green / both
keyboard scramble
bomb that takes out unused letters
  - eliminate X random unused letters

- free one-letter guess
- free one-letter magic guess (re-choose word to fit guess if possible)

- off-by-one tolerance

- vowel swap
  - no vowel hits ? fill in all vowels

- spear pillar randomly turn everything upside down / sidewars

- antiwordle
  - have to guess words that fit the clues
  - difference is that you want to guess more obscure things, etc

- ghost mode
  - 

all of my best ideas are ruined by the fact that the list of candidate words is so low after a few guesses






================

bugs:

clear all should do the same as clear all + refresh()
close button is being hit on last word submit
can use keyboard to enter guess even on game end options menu
tab can zoom around inactive modal buttons


================

higher-level:


dark mode
  - some hints can only be seen light, some dark
    - how to pull this off without making hints too obvious in light mode
      - maybe in dark mode, an obvious hint appears that leads to a similar but less conspicuous hint in light mode
    - hints to what? maybe a cheat code, or an answer to be inputted behind the options screen
